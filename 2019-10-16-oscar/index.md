The Russian Revolution of 1905 began with Tsar Nicholas II attempting to transform the Russian government from an autocracy to a monarchy. His attempt for a new system of government led to political and social unrest across the Russian Empire. Although this movement originally began many years before 1905, the "Bloody Sunday" massacre on the 22nd of January of that year is known to have sparked this revolution. When a bunch of workers, specially the poor, took on the streets and made their way to Tsar's Palace in hopes of presenting a petition for better working conditions, they were welcomed with gunfire. Worker strikes, urban uprisings, and peasant revolts continued  over the next several years. Now this is all just basic research that anyone can learn about using the internet. However, I wanted to go on further into this topic as it caught my attention while I was reading the _Egyptian Gazette_ newspaper. Before hand, I had no clue about this event in history. Being in the class of Microhisoty, I have been given the opportunity to access the archives, or newspaper articles, of the _Egyptian Gazette_. With this source, I was able to look into fresh insights of the roles individuals, social groups, and political parties played throughout the Russian Revolution. With this said, I was able to comprehend this event more vividly. As I did my search query, I wanted to see what this newspaper had to say about the "Bloody Sunday" massacre. The following day, the _Egyptian Gazette_ is full with information regarding this event and opinions what could come next. For example, it debates if Tsar's actions to preserve his autocracy will have serious consequences or will his power over the military suppress any opposition.
