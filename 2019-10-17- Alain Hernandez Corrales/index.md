Fire has been around since the dawn of time. The use of fire in different aspects has increased
but the dangers of being around it still are eye opening. On December 23, 1906 during the process of fire-setting,
they had not taken into account the length of the fuse. This error in calculation led to the death of two of the miners and injuries to four more.
This article functions as a way to show the hardships that can be endured in certain jobs and to be careful
with fire. From what I have researched on fire setting, it is a very simple procedure which shouldn't have
too big of a risk factor. While deaths mining are a common occurrence,
the cause of death is usually something less controllable. The awareness of the dangers of fire
have a larger impact on the community rather than just in the mining field. This occasion
makes the citizens of Alexandria question how well they are prepared in the case of a fire.
The article also shows how the community cares about those impacted by these tragedies. It states the condolences 
of the author. I can't quite tell if when the author says "the unfortunate victims, who leave large families.",
he is trying to say that the community was considered their family or literally meaning that they all had large families.
