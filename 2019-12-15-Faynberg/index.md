Nothing screams excitement more than finding a new *Mummy* to add to your cherished collection. Well, at least this is the case for novelist Pierre Loti who seems to struck gold in the next piece of his mummy collection. Yes, you read that correctly. Pierre Loti possess a collection of ancient Egyptian Mummies. This new mummy is said to hold a young princess and Loti claims to be one of the best in his collection, but never explains in what way. Best preserved? Best wrapped? Either way, Mr. Loti seems to be excited about his find.

Superstitions run high in Egypt during this time and touching the dead is a big no. Loti explains how none of his servants would lay their hands on the body, which resulted in Mr. Loti having to transport it himself. Only when he arrived upstairs with the mummy is when he realized he was holding on to a corpse. Either way, he added it to his study just as a kid would add a trophy to his trophy case and went along with his day. A typical day apparently in the life of Pierre Loti. Now if all this didn’t give off enough of an ominous vibe, right by Mr. Loti’s desk in his study resides the mummy of a three year old girl who watches as Loti writes. What an awkward study date that must be.
